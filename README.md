# AICTE-B4-Internship-Steganography
> AICTE Internship Capstone Project - Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography
***
## ðŸŒŸ Introduction

The digital age has witnessed an exponential increase in data transmission, raising significant concerns about data security and privacy. While cryptography focuses on encrypting data, steganography aims to conceal the very existence of data within other media. This project addresses the need for a practical and demonstrative tool to illustrate the principles of image steganography, specifically employing the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method.

The current challenge lies in providing a user-friendly application that effectively demonstrates:

* The process of embedding hidden messages within digital images using the LSB technique.
* The ability to accurately extract those hidden messages without noticeable degradation of the cover image.
* **Practical Application:** Emphasizes the need for a working application.

## ðŸ’¼ Requirements

- **Programming Language Used :** Python version 3.8 and above
- **Libraries used :** 
     - **OpenCV** - for image read and write and image to NumPy ndarray matrix for bit manipulation
     - **Tkinter** â€“ for GUI Elements like buttons, input box, text box etc.
     - **CustomTkinter** - Python UI library that builds upon Tkinter, offers a more modern and customizable look for desktop applications
     - **PIL** â€“ (optional) for application decorative Image display
     - **OS** â€“ for operating system support for file read and write within python application
     - **Time** â€“ (optional) for application simulated delayed effects
     - **Threading** â€“ for application parallel background file processing.
- **Platform :** 
  - OS ( Windows 10 and above or Linux )
  - at least 4GB of RAM
  - any modern processor or microcontroller with clock speed of 1GHz or higher
  - for optimal functioning system HDD requirement at least 50 GB.
  - IDE : python supported IDE ( Spyder used for this project ) or command-line (PowerShell or Terminal)
